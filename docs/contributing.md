## 🚀 Getting Started

### Development Setup

   ```
4. **Run the development server**:

   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your feature/fix:

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** and commit them:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add your descriptive commit message"
   ```
3. **Push to your fork**:

   ```
4. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub Issues to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/fromedwin/monitor/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## 💡 Suggesting Features

We use GitHub Issues to track feature requests too! When suggesting a feature:

1. **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Describe the problem** you're solving
3. **Describe the solution** you'd like
4. **Describe alternatives** you've considered

## 📝 Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! You can:

- Fix typos or improve clarity
- Add examples
- Write tutorials
- Improve API documentation

Documentation is built with Sphinx and uses Markdown files in the `docs/` directory.

## 🧪 Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Run the test suite: `python manage.py test`

## 📋 Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## 🏷️ Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Reference related issues** in your PR description
2. **Include tests** for new functionality
3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Keep PRs focused** - one feature/fix per PR
5. **Write clear commit messages**
