# Metrics

## InfluxDB

InfluxDB store time serie data generated by telegraf saving prometheus metrics data at regular interval. Telegraf does not need prometheus and read metrics directly.

Django calls InfluxDb directly to display graph and data.

## RabbitMQ's connections

Main metrics is coming from RabbitMQ to track connection and so number of workers running.
