# Introduction

FromEdwin Monitor was born from a real wake-up call: discovering that my project had been down for days without me knowing. This frustrating experience highlighted the critical need for reliable monitoring that doesn't require constant attention or complex setup.

## The Problem

When building and growing projects, solo entrepreneurs and small teams often find themselves wishing for someone who could keep an eye on their applications, monitor their health, and report back regularly or alert them immediately when something goes wrong. This would allow them to focus on what they do best - building and growing - rather than spending countless hours configuring and maintaining monitoring systems.

## The Solution

With the advent of AI and modern monitoring tools, this has become easier to fulfill. **FromEdwin** is an implementation of an easy solution - an automated monitoring companion designed to watch over applications and infrastructure.

## Philosophy

FromEdwin Monitor is built on the principle of **"opinionated but simple"**. It's designed to work out of the box with minimal configuration, providing users with:

- **Immediate deployment** - Get started in minutes, not hours
- **Comprehensive monitoring** - Availability, performance, and more
- **Smart alerts** - Get notified when things matter
- **Beautiful dashboards** - Clear, actionable insights
- **Zero maintenance** - Edwin handles the monitoring so you don't have to
  
The philosophy culminates in regular "FromEdwin" reports - weekly insights into your system's health and performance. Yes, that's where the name comes from - Edwin sends you regular updates, just like a reliable colleague who keeps you in the loop!
