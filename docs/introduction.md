# Introduction

FromEdwin is a fast, easy-to-use, and highly opinionated monitoring solution designed for small business owners and web developers with side projects in mind. 

## Why an other monitoring app ?

FromEdwin is based on existing monitoring solutions, rather than being a completely new product. It offers a none customizable configuration setup that enables quick and easy monitoring of systems and applications, making it a highly opinionated and time-saving solution for basic needs.

Designed to fulfill a specific need on one of our projects, it was decided to make it available as a SaaS version, allowing others to benefit from its simplicity as well, with the idea that if it works well for us, it might work well for others.

## List of features 

- Monitors the **HTTP status code** of a specified URL
- Notifies users of changes via **PagerDuty** notifications
- Uses **GitHub for single sign-on** to simplify authentication
- Provides a **public status page** to share availability information
