FromEdwin
=========

This documentation provides an overview of the FromEdwin project, an **out-of-the-box**, **highly opinionated**, **open-source** implementation of a **monitoring tool**. 

The main goal is to provide a **fast to implement** solutions for monitoring your systems and applications. 

Currently, the tool focuses on **availability monitoring**, but our plan is to expand to include **performance**, **statistics**, **budget**, and **energy consumption**. 

It is designed for *small business owners* looking as an **easy-to-use** and **easy-to-configure** monitoring solution. This documentation will guide you through the process of **setting up your own instance**, or also provide for contributors an understanding of the overall architecture to **aid in its maintenance**.
